# TypeScript Practice Project

This project is designed for practicing exercises in TypeScript. It provides a directory structure for organizing your exercise files and test cases.

## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

```
typescript-practice
├── src
│   ├── exercise1.ts
│   ├── exercise2.ts
│   ├── exercise3.ts
│   └── ...
├── test
│   ├── exercise1.test.ts
│   ├── exercise2.test.ts
│   ├── exercise3.test.ts
│   └── ...
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

- `src`: This directory contains the TypeScript files for each exercise. You can write your TypeScript implementation of the exercises in these files.

- `test`: This directory contains the test cases for each exercise. You can write your test cases using a testing framework like Jest in these files.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.

- `tsconfig.json`: This file is the configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies the compiler options and the files to include in the compilation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Implement the exercises in the `src` directory.

4. Write test cases for the exercises in the `test` directory.

5. Run the tests using the following command:

   ```
   npm test
   ```

6. Verify that all the tests pass.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each exercise.
